    <p>This vegetarian Thai green curry recipe is very simple to make from scratch, 
    you don't even need any premade curry paste. Once you make this yourself, 
    it will be hard to go back to anything packaged, as this green curry tastes like 
    a green curry should—very fresh and zinging with taste, thanks to many ingredients, 
    including lemongrass. The coconut milk lends a creaminess without making the curry too rich.</p>

    <p>It includes tofu or chickpeas (your choice) for protein, plus lots of vegetables for an
    excellent vegetarian or vegan curry you'll want to serve both family and friends. 
    It's very aromatic and flavorful, and easy to love. If you've never worked with lemongrass 
    before, you can find it in many supermarkets fresh, or sometimes the stalks are available frozen. 
    As with many curries, this one's pretty adaptable, so feel free to experiment with other vegetables, 
    such as chopped yam, squash, snow peas, eggplant, broccoli, and bok choy, among others. 
    And of course, curry is especially great served with rice; it sops up some of that great flavor,
    and also provides a starchy balance to the curry's heat.</p>

        <li>1/4 can coconut milk</li>

        <li>1 cup packed fresh cilantro leaves and stems</li>
        <li>1 shallot, chopped</li>
        <li>4 to 5 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 (1- to 2-inch) piece galangal (or ginger), sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
    <br/>
    <strong>For The Remainder Of The Dish:</strong>
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups cubed firm tofu (or canned chickpeas, rinsed and drained)</li>
        <li>1/2 to 3/4 cup vegetable stock or water</li>
        <li>2 to 3 fresh or frozen makrut lime leaves</li>
        <li>3/4 can coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>1 to 1 1/2 cups chopped asparagus (or green beans)</li>
        <li>1 large handful cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh Thai basil (or sweet basil)</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <br/>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Place all green curry paste ingredients in a food processor or blender and blitz to create
            a fragrant green curry paste; you may need to add more coconut milk if using a blender.
            To make the sauce by hand: Mince and stir all sauce ingredients together in a bowl, 
            or use a mortar and pestle to mash dry ingredients followed by liquid ingredients. 
            Set aside.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Place a wok or large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons oil and swirl 
            around, then add the green curry paste. Stir-fry for 1 minute to release the fragrance.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Add the tofu or chickpeas and stir until all ingredients are covered well with sauce.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Add the stock plus lime leaves (if using). Stir and reduce heat to medium-low. Gently simmer 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Add the coconut milk and the vegetables, and simmer 10 to 13 minutes, or until the vegetables have softened.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Remove curry from heat and taste for salt and spice.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Serve directly out of the wok, or transfer to a serving bowl. Sprinkle over the fresh basil 
            (gently tear larger leaves into shreds). Sliced red chile peppers can also be used as a topping,
             one that adds more heat.</li>
        <br/>
   
   
   
    </ol>
